# üöÄ DFDEZ Store - An E-commerce Analytics Sandbox

Welcome to the DFDEZ Store! This isn't your average e-commerce site. It was built from the ground up as a comprehensive, real-world sandbox for testing and mastering web analytics implementations. While it functions as a full-stack MERN application, its primary purpose is to serve as a playground for deploying and validating tracking setups with Google Tag Manager, GA4, and more.

The entire project was guided and co-developed with the help of Google's Gemini 2.5 PRO.
